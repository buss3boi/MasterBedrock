# MasterBedrock
Master Thesis on estimation of bedrock sediment thickness with classic vs newer methods
The folders in Aarungen example contains python scripts from the work i have done.

- DEM includes the DEM file and calculation of anisotropic scaling factors.
- DQM contains the bedrock polygon file along with preprocessing of the data to filtrate and add new boreholde points.
- granada contains the raw borehole data and kriging interpolation methods, kriging validation and kriging prediction surface.
- Regression contains our regression machine learning methods with tuning of models throught validation, and plotting of prediction surfaces.

No figures or data is saved in the repository. However these files will automatically save most figures to the machine. 

If you have any questions on the thesis or data itself, feel free to send me a mail on: bastian.oian@gmail.com
